Question:

	I have a question about #include fileName and compiling multiple files together. I had thought C++ when compiling files together this copied and pasted the files below each and ran the program
	meaning I could declare methods in one and use have the implementation else. However it seems that I can only put the method declartions in .h files, is this true?
